# Features

Features (or system behaviors) are documented in [Gerkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/), which is considered as an effective way of communication among stakeholders, regardless of their technical background.

Feature specifications focus more on what the system does, and less on how they look visually. 
This way, the feature descriptions won't need to change dramatically when look-and-feel changes without functional change.
We also try to make things most intuitive, so that users don't need to think too much and would mostly know what to do and how to do it based on their experience with other applications.
